<h1>Description:</h1>
PyRell is an advanced tool designed to efficiently execute large sets of API collections in parallel, significantly reducing execution time to just a few seconds or minutes.

<h1>Features:</h1>
PyRell consumes an API collection along with its associated environment file and seamlessly initiates execution.
It offers flexible grouping logic, allowing users to specify the number of API groups to be run simultaneously.
For instance, if there are 10 APIs, the tool can be configured to create 10 groups and execute them in parallel.
Upon completion, PyRell generates comprehensive reports in both HTML and CSV formats, detailing the execution status of each API and group.
These reports are user-friendly, making it easy to review the results.
In addition, the tool automatically sends an email with the HTML and CSV reports, as well as the executed API collection and environment file, ensuring all relevant data is easily accessible.
All these features can be triggered with a single click, provided the system or IDE is properly configured and set up.

<h1>Usages:</h1>
PyRell is ideal for companies or individuals who looking to execute large sets of APIs rapidly, providing detailed reports and notifications via email with just a single click. It is a powerful tool for ensuring the smooth functioning of a product, platform, or system by identifying and resolving issues efficiently, helping to maintain a bug-free environment.

<h1>Performance</h1>

This performance compares 1,000 assertions/API calls using the most popular trending tools Postman, Newman, and Insomnia. Notably, only PyRell supports parallel execution, along with comprehensive reporting and email notifications, the other tools only facilitate sequential execution.

In this context, PyRell executes in approximately 3 to 4 minutes when run in parallel, and it also provides reports and executed API/assertions via email. In contrast, the other tools require over 35 to 40 minutes due to their sequential execution.

Even when PyRell is executed sequentially, it still takes less time compared to Postman, Newman, and Insomnia, due to its seamless backend integration. Additionally, it provides comprehensive reports and email notifications within that timeframe.
