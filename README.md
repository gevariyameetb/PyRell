<h1>Description:</h1>
PyRell is an advanced tool designed to efficiently execute large sets of API collections in parallel, significantly reducing execution time to just a few seconds or minutes.

<h1>Features:</h1>
PyRell consumes an API collection along with its associated environment file and seamlessly initiates execution.
It offers flexible grouping logic, allowing users to specify the number of API groups to be run simultaneously.
For instance, if there are 10 APIs, the tool can be configured to create 10 groups and execute them in parallel.
Upon completion, PyRell generates comprehensive reports in both HTML and CSV formats, detailing the execution status of each API and group.
These reports are user-friendly, making it easy to review the results.
In addition, the tool automatically sends an email with the HTML and CSV reports, as well as the executed API collection and environment file, ensuring all relevant data is easily accessible.
All these features can be triggered with a single click, provided the system or IDE is properly configured and set up.

<h1>Usages:</h1>
PyRell is ideal for companies or individuals looking to execute large sets of APIs rapidly, providing detailed reports and notifications via email with just a single click. It is a powerful tool for ensuring the smooth functioning of a product, platform, or system by identifying and resolving issues efficiently, helping to maintain a bug-free environment.
